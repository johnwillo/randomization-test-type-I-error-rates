# Test of type I error rates from a randomization test through simulation
This paper examines, through simulations, how well a two-sample randomization test (also called a permutation test) approximates the desired Type I error specified in the test. The results for equal and unequal sample sizes and equal and unequal variances are examined, both for normal and skewed distributions.
